Synchronous : Main Stack -> if there is any process existeted in the main stack, it will be executed one by until it becomes empty.

Asynchronous : Side / Call Stack then the process is taken one by one from the Call stack to  main stack for the execution. 


Event Loop checks for the emptiness of the main Stack. if it is empty then it will take up the process from the call / Side stack to the main stack for execution.
